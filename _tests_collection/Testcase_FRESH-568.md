## #263 Delivery Conditions Flag sometimes not set in Procurement Candidates

> Testcase to check if the Delivery Conditions Flag is set correctly in Procurement Candidates

1. Make sure you have flatrate terms for procurement for G000X for:
	* P0001: qty for current month, no price set
	* P0002: no qty for current month, no price set
	* P0003: qty & price for current month set
	
1. Make sure P0004 is also available as Produkt fÃ¼r Lieferantenvertrag, but G000X has no flatrate term for it

1. In WebUI, log in for G000X and send qty to deliver for all 4 products, for date of test

1. Open procurement candidates, and search for G000X and date of test:

	| Product | checkbox V  |
	| ------- | ----------- |
	| P0001   | checked     |
	| P0002   | not checked |
	| P0003   | checked     |
	| P0004   | not checked |
	
	
	* => if the qty is set for the month, a price is not necessary!
	* => if no qty is set, it's like there is no flatrate term for this period!
