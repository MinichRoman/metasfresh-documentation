## Overview
metasfresh uses Swagger to expose REST API functions and endpoints.

You can reach the REST API by appending `/app/swagger-ui/index.html` to your personal instance/server URL, which is usually composed as follows:
- `https://<yourserver:port>/app/swagger-ui/index.html`

Via Swagger you can browse through and use all [available endpoints](../../pages/rest_api/index_en).<br>
For more information about using the REST API, please refer to our [general guide on the metasfresh web service](General_info_REST_API).

## Next Steps (optional)
- [Change the user session language via Swagger](set_user_session_language_via_swagger).
- [Enable the Developer View using Swagger](enable_developer_view_via_Swagger).
