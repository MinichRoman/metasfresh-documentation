To check out the metasfresh source code, go to the different metasfreshs repositories at [https://github.com/metasfresh/](https://github.com/metasfresh/) and create your initial clones.

Particularly if you are new to git, we recommend installing _GitHub Desktop_ from [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) and then use the "Open in Desktop"
option. Also note that we basically follow the "GitHub Flow" which is documented at [https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

The projects to clone are
* [https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-parent](https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-parent)
* [https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh](https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh)
* [https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-webui](https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-webui)
* [https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-procurement-webui](https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-procurement-webui)
* [https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-webui-frontend](https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-webui-frontend)
* [https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-dist](https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-dist)


As a sidenote: we recommend that you clone all the metasfresh repos to the same location.
For this documentation, i'm using `C:\developement\repos`, so the individual repos' working copies are located at be `C:\developement\repos\metasfresh` and `C:\developement\repos\metasfres-parent` etc.
