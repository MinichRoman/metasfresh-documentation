Click on in window e.g. sales order to jump to other data like shipment schedule, invoice schedule, etc. in order to navigate through the workflow.
Example: Clicking on Shipment Disposition from sales order window will open the window “Shipment Disposition” only showing the records that are related to the sales order we started from.
