### Overview
If you want to use server-based mass printing either for real, physical printers or virtual (PDF) printers you need to enable the corresponding system configuration which by default is turned off (`N`).

Mind that this change requires a **restart of the App Server** to become effective.

## Steps
1. Open "System Configuration" from the [menu](../webui_collection/EN/Menu).
1. [Use the filter](../webui_collection/EN/Filtering_function) and search for the system configuration with the **Name** `de.metas.printing.Enabled`.
1. Open the system configuration entry.
1. In the field **Search Key**, enter `Y` and hit `â†µ Enter` to apply.
1. **IMPORTANT:** Restart the App Server for the change to become effective.

### SQL Command Example
```SQL
  update ad_sysconfig
  set value='Y'
  where name='de.metas.printing.Enabled'
```
