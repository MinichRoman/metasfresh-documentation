		<!-- first a link to the start-page (might be removed later) -->

Commenting it all out for now, because 
* we don't want to provide a static index.html file in every folder, but I currently don't know how else to make all the generated links work.
  note that i also don't know how to check if there is a file to creawte a nav-bar-link to
* we will probably reorganize the whole folder structure wrt multilang
* having this breadcrump-navigation is just one thing we like to have, and it's probably not the most important thing.

Note: i'm betting that nexted comments don't work, so i'm note trying to comment out the whole thing.
Instead i sortof disable it by assigning zero to "max_path_index" further below
{% endcomment %}

{% comment %}
Get the curent page's path, tokenize it using "/" and provide a link for each token
TODO: for the correct link text, we actually need the especting translation, using somthing like
{{ site.pages | where ... }}
{% endcomment %}

{% comment %} make an array by splitting the path around each "/" {% endcomment %}
{% assign path_tokens = page.path | split: "/" %}

{% comment %} get the number of "path tokens" i.e. "/", but is nothe the "//"s from "http://"
{% assign max_path_index = path_tokens.size | minus: 2 %}
==> disabling this whole thing (see above) by setting max_path_index = 0
{% endcomment %}
{% assign max_path_index = -1 %}

{% assign path = "" %}
{% for c in (0..max_path_index) %}
		<li>
	{% capture path %}{{ path }}/{{path_tokens[c]}}{% endcapture %}
			<a href="{{ path }}/">{{path_tokens[c]}}</a>
		</li>	
{% endfor %}
