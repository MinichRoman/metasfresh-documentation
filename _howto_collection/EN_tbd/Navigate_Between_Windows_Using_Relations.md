#How To use Relations to browse through the workflow

![Workflow](../images/workflow_simple_order_to_invoice.png)

Click on ![Icon](../images/icon_relation.png) in window e.g. sales order to jump to other windows like shipment disposition, invoice schedule, etc. in order to navigate through the workflow.

Example: Clicking on **Shipment Disposition** from sales order window will open the window **Shipment Disposition** thus  showing only the records that are related to the sales order we started from.
