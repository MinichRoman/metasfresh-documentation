Instead of using RUN_metasfresh.exe you can also use a startup script. This might become necessary if you would like to start metasfresh on Unix (Mac / Linux) or in case you would like to add [commnad line parameters](Which_command_line_parameters_are_available_for_the_metasfresh_client) during startup.

You can find the startup script in the [metasfresh client directory](How_to_install_metasfresh_client) on:

**Windows**

```
metasfresh\RUN_metasfresh.bat
```

**Mac / Linux**

```
metasfresh/RUN_metasfresh_linux.sh
```
