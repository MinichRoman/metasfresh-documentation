## General

In general all search fields can be used to access, view or edit the data embedded in it. This is done by just clicking on it.


## Example

1. Open the window "Sales Order"
1. Add a customer in the field **Auftraggeber**
1. Use the right mouse button on the field **Auftraggeber**
1. Click on the icon "![img](../../images/icons/Zoom24.png) Jump to"
1. The window Business Partner now opens and applies a filter with the customer which you have previously seen in the the window "Sales Order".

   **Note:** The window which has been opened has a filter applied to it which displays exactly the partner which has been inserted in the Sales Order window. Using this method allows you to see the other business partners available.
