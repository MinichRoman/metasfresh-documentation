metasfresh supports an unlimited amount of tenants. Data of these tenants are logically separated and therefore they are not visible among each other.


Tentant|Purpose
---|---
System|Contains all system objects such as windows, registers, fields, reports, processes, settings
metasfresh AG |Is preconfigured for use and contains sample data.
Further tenants|Basically you can add as many tenants as you wish. *Note:*: Adding new tenants involves some configuration work. Therefore we recommend further usage of the standard tenant "metasfresh AG"
