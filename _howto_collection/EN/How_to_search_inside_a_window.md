## Simple Search

1. Just open a window with a document or a window displaying business partner information. As an example you can use ["Business Partner"](How_to_find_and_open_a_window)
1. Inside the window click the following symbol in the symbol bar ![img](../images/icons/Find24.png)
 => A search bar should pop up now.

1. Insert a search string in the standard search field. For example you might want to use "test" in the ***Name*** field.
1. [Click OK] (How_to_confirm_an_action)
