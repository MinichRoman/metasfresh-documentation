## Overview
In metasfresh, you can export any selected data from any list view, download them to your computer and save them in an XLS file.

You can also easily [export all product specifications](Export_product_data) in one go.

## Steps
1. [Open a window](Menu) of your choice in the [list view](ViewModes), e.g., "Business Partner".
1. [Select](RecordSelection) the lines you want to export.
1. [Start the action](StartAction) "Download selected". The "Save As" dialog box opens up with the default file name "report", which you may certainly change ad lib.
1. Save the file in a directory of your choice.
1. Browse to this directory and open the file in a spreadsheet software, such as *Microsoft Excel*.
