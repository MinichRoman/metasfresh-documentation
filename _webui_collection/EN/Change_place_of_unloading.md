## Overview
In metasfresh, you can determine an alternate place of unloading if the address of the receiving warehouse is different from the respective organization's default address. This address will then also appear on the respective purchase order confirmations.

## Steps
1. [In the business partner entry of the respective organization, record the address of the place of unloading](Add_address_tab).
1. [Open the entry](Menu) of the [warehouse](Add_new_warehouse) you want to use for [receiving goods](CreateGoodsReceipt) and change its **Partner Location** to the alternate address.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
