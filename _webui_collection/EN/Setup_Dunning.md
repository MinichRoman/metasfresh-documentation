## Overview
Before you can start a [Dunning Run](Dunning_Run), you need to set up the dunning procedure first. In metasfresh you can also individualize this procedure for single customers and business partner groups.

## Steps
1. [Configure the Outbound Documents](Outbound_Documents_Config_Dunning) for the dunning procedure.
1. Define a [Dunning Type](Define_Dunning_Type) with at least one level.
1. [Link](link_dunning_type_to_partner) this dunning type to a single [customer](New_business_partner_customer) or a [business partner group](New_Business_Partner_Group).
