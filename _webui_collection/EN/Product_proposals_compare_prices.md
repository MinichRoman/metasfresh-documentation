## Overview
Via product proposals in a [sales order](SalesOrder_recording) or [purchase order](CreatePurchaseOrder) you can make a price check and quickly take a look at the various prices at which a product is traded with other [business partners](New_Business_Partner). You can then also add these prices to your current price list, if necessary.

## Steps
1. [Open the product proposals list](Product_proposals_open_list).
1. [Select](RecordSelection) the line of the product whose price you want to compare with others.
1. [Start the quick action](StartAction) "Other customers". All the entries are displayed of the business partners with whom the selected product was recently traded and at which price.
1. [Select](RecordSelection) the lines with the product prices you want to add to your current price list.
1. [Start the quick action](StartAction) "Add products". The selected product prices have now been added to the product proposals list.
1. [Select](RecordSelection) the lines with the newly added product prices.
1. [Start the quick action](StartAction) "Save to price list". The new product prices have now been added to the respective price list.

### Save and continue
1. Click "Done" to apply the changes and close the product proposals list.
1. Continue with the remaining steps of creating a [sales order](SalesOrder_recording) or [purchase order](CreatePurchaseOrder), if necessary.

## Next Steps (optional)
- [Use the product proposals list when entering a sales/purchase order](Product_proposals_sales_purchase_order).
- [Use the product proposals list to edit product prices and price lists directly from a sales/purchase order](Product_proposals_edit_prices).
- [Add products to a price list via product proposals](Product_proposals_add_products).
- [Remove products from a price list via product proposals](Product_proposals_remove_products).
