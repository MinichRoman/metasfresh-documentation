## Overview
The product proposals list serves to gain an overview of all products on a currently valid price list. Likewise it can be used to quickly and easily compare the prices at which a specific product from the price list is traded with other business partners. Moreover, it is possible to add new products to or remove deprecated ones from a price list, even while entering a sales order or purchase order.

In order to use the product proposals list to enter a sales order or purchase order, please proceed as follows:

## Steps

1. [Open the product proposals list in a sales order](Product_proposals_open_list).
1. Pick out the product of your choice from the product proposals and enter a quantity into the field in the column **Quantity**.<br> Hit `↵ Enter` to apply.
 >**Note:** Repeat this procedure for further products you want to add to the sales order.

1. ***Optional:*** Adjust the product price by double-clicking the field in the column **Price** and entering a different value.<br> Hit `↵ Enter` to apply.
