## Steps
1. Open the entry of an existing [calendar](Menu) or [add a new one](Add_new_calendar).
1. Go to the record tab "Year" at the bottom of the page and click ![](assets/Add_New_Button.png). A new window opens up.
1. Enter the **Year** for which you want to create a new period, e.g. "2019".
1. Click "Done" to close the window and add the year to the list.
1. Select the newly created tab entry and [start the action](StartAction) "Create Periods". A new window opens up.
1. Enter a **Start Date**, e.g. "01/01/2019".
1. Click "Start" to create the periods and close the window.
1. Use the [context menu](Jumpto_via_context_menu) ![](assets/Calendar periods context menu.png) of the newly created year entry from before to switch into the window "Calendar Periods" where you will see a list of all the months from this period.
