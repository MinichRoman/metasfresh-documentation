## Overview
In metasfresh, you can automatically create individual lists with delivery days that are based on tour scheduling schemas comprising various versions of partner-specific delivery days and preparation times. This enables you to schedule delivery tours far in advance while staying up to date and keeping track of pending tours, delivery days and contacts at all times.

Moreover, you can define "buffers", which represent the time between dispatch and actual delivery of the goods, as well as mark completed deliveries as processed, in order to keep a clear overview of the tour list.

## Steps
1. [Add a tour scheduling schema](Add_tour_scheduling_schema).
1. [Add a tour version](Add_tour_version).
1. [Create automatic tour lists](Create_automatic_tour_lists).
