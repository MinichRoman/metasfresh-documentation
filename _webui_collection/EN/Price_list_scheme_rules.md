## Overview
You can add rules to a price list scheme that will be applied when copying price lists, e.g. surcharges or similar.

## Steps
1. Open "Price List Schema" from the [menu](Menu).
1. Open the price list scheme named "Copy Price Lists".
1. Go to the tab "Schema Line" at the bottom of the page and click ![](assets/Add_New_Button.png). A new window opens up.
1. Enter a **Standard Price Surcharge Amount**.
1. Click "Done" to close the window and add the rule to the list.

Next time you are using this price list scheme when copying a price list, all affected products will receive the defined surcharge on their standard price.
