## Overview
In metasfresh you can autonomously translate your products' names into your business partners' languages. The moment you [add a new product](NewProduct), new entries are created under "Product Translation" where you can then edit your translations.

When you [change your interface language](SwitchLanguage) and [create a sales order](SalesOrder_recording), for example, you will see the product name appear in the respective language when adding the products.

Or when you [print commercial documents](PrintPreview) for business partners who speak another language, the translated product name will appear on these documents accordingly.

## Open the translation entry

### a) Via the navigation menu
1. Open "Product Translation" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Use the filter](Filtering_function) to find the product for which you want to add a translation. There is one entry for each available language (see column **Language**).

### b) Jumping from the product via the sidebar
If you are already looking at the entry of the product you want to translate, you can take the following steps:

1. Use the product's [related documents to jump](JumptoviaSidebar) into the window "Product Translation" (under "Product Management" in the sidebar).
1. In the window "Product Translation" you will see all translation entries for the selected product.

## Add translations
1. Open the entry of the language into which you want to translate, e.g. "Deutsch (CH)".
1. Replace the existing **Name** with your translation.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
