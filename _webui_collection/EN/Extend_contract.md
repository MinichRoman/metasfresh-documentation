## Steps

### a) Via "Contract" in the menu
1. Open "Contract" from the [menu](Menu).
1. From the [list view](ViewModes), [select](RecordSelection) the [contract](Create_subscription_contract) you want to extend.
1. [Start the action](StartAction) "Extend Contract". An overlay window opens up.
 >**Note:** You can also start this action directly from the respective contract's entry.

1. Select *Yes* for **Auto-complete new Contract Period**.
1. Choose a **Start Date**.
1. Click "Start" to extend the contract and close the overlay window.

### b) From the sales order
1. Open the [sales order](Menu) you used to create the contract.
1. [Start the action](StartAction) "Extend contract". A new sales order opens up in the same tab. It is already filled in with the same information from the contract being extended.
1. Adjust the information, if necessary, and [complete the contract](DocumentProcessingComplete).
