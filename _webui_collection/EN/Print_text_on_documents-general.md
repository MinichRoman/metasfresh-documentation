## Overview
In metasfresh, you can add your own text to your supporting documents, thereby modifying them to meet the needs and requirements of your business.

For instance, you can put a description at the top of a quotation and leave a note for your customer at the bottom or you can add a text describing the ordered product in more detail.

You can record these texts in metasfresh in a number of different ways. Upon document creation, the texts will then be automatically placed in the spaces provided on the supporting document.

The following figure of a quotation highlights the modifiable text passages and points out the menu items where they can be edited in metasfresh:
