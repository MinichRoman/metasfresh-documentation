## Overview
In metasfresh you can add manual text to your documents and thereby modify them to meet the needs and requirements of your business.

For instance, you can put a description at the top of a quotation and leave a note for your customer at the bottom or you can add a text that describes the ordered product in more detail.

You can record these texts in metasfresh in a number of different ways. Upon document creation, the texts will then be automatically placed in the spaces provided on the document.

The following image of a quotation shows you the modifiable text passages and where to edit them in metasfresh:
