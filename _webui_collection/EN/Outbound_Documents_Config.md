## Overview
You can set up the Outbound Documents for a variety of tables so the documents that are created, such as invoices, shipment notes, dunning letters etc., get listed under "Outbound Documents" in the menu where you can then continue to process them either one by one or by the dozen.

## Steps
1. Open "Outbound Documents Config" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Create a new configuration entry](New_Record_Window).
1. Start typing the name of the **Table** you want to configure and select the corresponding one from the suggestions, e.g. "Dunning".
1. Select a **Print Format**.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
