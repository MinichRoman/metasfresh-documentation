| :--- | :--- |
| Notify supervisor<br> ("*Betreuer benachrichtigen*") | A notification will be sent to the supervisor. |
| E-mail | A notification will be sent to the user via e-mail only. |
| Notice | A notification will be sent to the user's notifications inbox ![](assets/NotificationBell_WebUI.png) only. |
