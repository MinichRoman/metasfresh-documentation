## Overview
In metasfresh, you can easily export all product specifications in one go.

## Steps
1. Open "Product" from the [menu](Menu) in the [list view](ViewModes).
1. [Start the action](StartAction) "Export Product Specifications". The "Save As" dialog box opens up with the default file name "Report_#", which you may certainly change ad lib.
1. Save the file in a directory of your choice.
1. Browse to this directory and open the file in a spreadsheet software, such as *Microsoft Excel*.
