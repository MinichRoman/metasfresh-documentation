1. Enter the name of the designated **Price List Version**, e.g. "New Price List Germany".
  > Note: Hit `SPACE` to see all available price lists.

1. In the field **Standard Price** you can determine the effective purchase or retail price (depending on the respective price list).

## Further Relevant Fields
1. The field **List Price** only serves to set the list price that will appear on the documents.
1. **Limit Price**: Manual price changes made by the user, e.g. in the order line, must not fall below this amount!
1. The field **UOM** determines the unit of measurement for which the price applies and must not be confused with the product's UOM used for Inventory Management.
