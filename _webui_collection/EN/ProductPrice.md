## Steps
1. Open the entry of an existing [product](Menu) or [add a new one](NewProduct).
1. Go to the record tab "Price" at the bottom of the page and click !["Add new"](assets/Add_New_Button.png). An overlay window opens up.
1. Pick a [**Price List Version**](Add_price-list-version), e.g., "Customer Price List" ([for sales](Assign_prices_to_partner#sales-price-list)) or "Vendor Price List" ([for purchasing](Assign_prices_to_partner#purchase-price-list)).
1. Enter a **Standard Price**.
1. Pick a **UOM** (unit of measurement) for which the price shall apply (sales UOM).
 >**Note:** If sales UOM â‰  stock-keeping UOM (see [Product](NewProduct)), you have to define a [UOM conversion](Convert_UOMs).

1. In the field **Tax Category**, pick a value-added tax (VAT) category, such as *normal*, *reduced*, *tax-free*, etc.
1. In the field **Invoiceable Quantity per**, pick the weight to be used for invoicing, e.g., *Nominal* weight (default) or *Catch Weight* ([for products with variable weight](Sales_order_catch_weight)).
1. Click "Done" to close the overlay window and add the price to the list.
