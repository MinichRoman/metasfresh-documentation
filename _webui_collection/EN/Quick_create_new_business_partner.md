## Overview
If in the course of creating a [Sales Order](SalesOrder_recording) or a [Purchase Order](CreatePurchaseOrder) you realize that the relevant Business Partner does not yet exist in your system, you can very easily quick create them from that same window.

## Steps
1. In the field **Business Partner** ([Sales Order](SalesOrder_recording)) or **Delivery from** ([Purchase Order](CreatePurchaseOrder)), enter a part of the unavailable Partner's name. A drop-down list opens up.<br>

1. Fill in the fields **Firstname** and **Lastname**.
1. ***Optional:*** Fill in the fields **Email** and **Phone**.
1. If the Partner is a Company, check the box **Is Company** and also fill in the field **Company Name**.
1. Select a **Partner Group**.
1. Select the Partnerâ€™s preferred language for communication.
1. Click on the "Edit"-Button to add an **Address**.
1. Enter the **Address**, **ZIP** code, **City** and **Country** of the Partner.
 >**Note:** If you choose "United States" as country, you can also enter the **Region**. Simply close and re-open the address editing window by clicking the edit-button twice and the field will appear above **Country**.

1. Click on "Done" to save the new Business Partner, close the window and continue editing your Sales Order or Purchase Order.

**Note:** You will find the newly created Business Partner under "[Business Partner](Menu)" in the menu.
