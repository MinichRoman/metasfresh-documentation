## Overview
If in the course of creating a [sales order](SalesOrder_recording) or a [purchase order](CreatePurchaseOrder) you realize that the entry of the business partner in question does not yet exist in metasfresh, you can easily quick create it from that very window.

## Steps
1. In the field **Business Partner** ([Sales Order](SalesOrder_recording)) or **Delivery from** ([Purchase Order](CreatePurchaseOrder)), enter a part of the missing partner's name. A drop-down list opens up.<br>

1. Click on the option *New Business Partner*. An overlay window for the quick creation opens up.
1. Select a **Greeting**.
1. Fill in the fields **Firstname** and **Lastname**.
1. ***Optional:*** Fill in the fields **Email Address** and **Phone**.
1. If the business partner is a company, tick the checkbox **Company** and fill in the field **Company Name**. Otherwise, uncheck the box and enter the partner's **Name**.
1. Select a [**Business Partner Group**](New_Business_Partner_Group).
1. Select the partnerâ€™s preferred **Language** for communication.
1. Click on the !["Edit"](assets/Edit_address_button.png) button to add an **Address**.
1. Enter the **Street & House No.**, **ZIP** code, **City** and **Country** of the partner.
 >**Note:** If you choose "United States" as country, you can also enter the **Region**. Simply close and re-open the address editing window by clicking the edit button twice and the field will appear above **Country**.

1. ***Optional:*** Depending on the type of business relationship, tick the checkbox **Customer** and/or **Vendor**. Then pick a **(PO) Payment Term** and a **(Purchase) Pricing System**.
1. Click "Done" to save the new business partner, close the overlay window and continue editing your [sales order](SalesOrder_recording) or [purchase order](CreatePurchaseOrder).
