## Overview

Users are basically contacts with login permission. That is why you also find the contacts of your business partners in the "User" window.<br>
You can create new contacts or allow existing contacts to log on to the system by following these steps:

## Steps

### Create a contact
1. [Log on](Logon) to the system.
1. Open "User" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Create a new User](New_Record_Window).
1. Fill in the fields **Firstname** and **Lastname**.
1. Enter a **Search Key**.

### Turn the contact into a System User
1. Tick the box **System User** to give the contact user permissions.
1. In the field **Login** enter a username.
1. Enter a **Password** with at least 8 characters.

  > Note 1: Make sure the password consists of **at least 8 characters** or the new record **will not be saved**!<br><br>
  > Note 2: The user can log on using either the **login** or the **email address** as username.<br><br>
  > Note 3: The username and password are both **case-sensitive**!

### Assign a role to the user to grant permission
1. Go to the record tab "User Roles" at the bottom of the page.
1. [Add a new role](New_Record_Tab).
1. Pick the role you want to assign to the user.
1. Click "Done" to add the role to the list.

   > Note: A user can have several roles. In this case they will be asked to choose a role at the login.
