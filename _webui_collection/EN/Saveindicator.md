## Overview
metasfresh always saves automatically each time changes are made.

The color of the progress bar below the menu bar indicates the respective status of the save process.

| Color | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **<span style="color:#afafaf">grey</span>** | Saving... |
| **<span style="color:#8ad62d">green</span>** | Saving was successful. |
| **<span style="color:#e85667">red</span>** | Failed to save changes due to an error. |
