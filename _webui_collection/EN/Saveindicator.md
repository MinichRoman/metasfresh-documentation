## Overview
metasfresh always saves automatically each time changes are made.

The color of the progress bar below the menu bar indicates the respective status of the save process.

| Color | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| <span style="color:grey">grey</span> | Saving... |
| <span style="color:green">green</span> | Saving was successful. |
| <span style="color:red">red</span> | Failed to save changes due to an error. |
