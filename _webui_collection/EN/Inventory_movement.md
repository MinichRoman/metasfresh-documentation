## Overview
In metasfresh, you can very easily transfer [handling units (HUs)](Handling_Unit_System) from one warehouse to another.

## Steps
1. Open "Handling Unit Editor" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Select](RecordSelection) the handling units you want to transfer.
1. [Start the quick action](StartAction) "MoveToAnotherWarehouse". An overlay window opens up.
1. In the field **Warehouse**, enter a part of the [warehouse](Add_new_warehouse) name and click on the matching result in the [drop-down list](Keyboard_shortcuts_reference).
1. Click "Start" to close the overlay window and transfer the HUs.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
 >**Note:** [Use the filter](Filtering_function) to quickly find the transferred HUs.
