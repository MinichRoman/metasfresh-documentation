## Overview
With an authentication token you can authenticate yourself against the REST API of metasfresh, which authorizes you to use the web service.

## Steps
1. Open "User" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Use the filter](Filtering_function) to find the entry of the [user](Add_user) whose authentication token you want to view and open it.
1. Go to the record tab "Authentication Tokens" at the bottom of the page.

### Add a new authentication token
If no authentication token is shown under the record tab "Authentication Tokens", you can add a new one. To do so, please proceed as follows:

1. Click !["Add new"](assets/Add_New_Button.png). An overlay window opens up.
1. ***Optional:*** Enter a **Description**.
1. Pick a **Role** for which the token shall be valid.
1. Click "Done" to close the overlay window and add the token to the list.

| **Note:** |

| To copy the authentication token to the clipboard, double-click the field in the column **Authentication Token** of the token line (the token will turn grey) and press `Ctrl` + `C` / `âŒ˜ cmd` + `C`. Or open the [advanced edit menu](Open_AdvancedEditTab) of the token line, highlight the token there with the mouse and use the same keyboard shortcut. |
