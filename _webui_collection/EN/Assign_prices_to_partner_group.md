## Overview
<kbd><img src="assets/price system_assign prices to partner.png" alt="Fig.: Pricing System, Partners and Partner Groups"></kbd>

In metasfresh, there are *sales price lists* and *purchase price lists*. Sales price lists contain sales products and are [assigned to customers](Assign_prices_to_partner#sales-price-list), while purchase price lists are used for [vendors](Assign_prices_to_partner#purchase-price-list) and contain products for purchasing. These two types of price lists can also be assigned to [partner groups](New_Business_Partner_Group).

## Steps

### Assign price list to a partner group
1. Open the entry of an existing [business partner group](Menu) or [add a new one](New_Business_Partner_Group).
 >**Note:** Alternatively, open a [business partner entry](New_Business_Partner) and [jump to the content of the field](Jumpto) **Business Partner Group**.

1. Pick the desired **Pricing System**.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).

## Next Steps (alternative)
- [Assign price lists to single business partners](Assign_prices_to_partner_group).
