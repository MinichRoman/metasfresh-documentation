## Overview
A subscription contract is a contract for delivery by instalments. It is a contract for the regular delivery of goods of the same type during a certain period of time.

## Requirements
- [Define the contractual terms for the subscription contract](Define_contractual_terms).

## Steps
To create a subscription contract, simply follow the same steps as for a [sales order](SalesOrder_recording). However, ***before completing the document***, make sure to complete these steps first:

1. Move the horizontal scrollbar of the order line table to the right until you reach the column **Terms & Conditions**.
1. Double-click the field **Terms & Conditions** of the order lines and select the desired [contractual terms](Define_contractual_terms) from the drop-down list.
 >**Note on changing the contractual terms:** After setting the contractual terms for the first time you cannot change them anymore. To use other contractual terms, simply delete the order line and enter it again.

| The field **Date Promised** now determines the ***Contract Start*** date. |

| After completing the sales order you will find the subscription contract under "[Contract](Menu)" in the menu. You can also jump ***directly*** to the contract via the sales order's [related documents](JumptoviaSidebar) (under CONTRACT MANAGEMENT in the sidebar). |
