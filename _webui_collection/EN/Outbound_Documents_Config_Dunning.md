You need to configure the Outbound Documents for dunning so the dunning letters that are created will also get listed under "Outbound Documents" in the menu where you can then continue to process them either one by one or by the dozen.

## Steps
Follow [these instructions](Outbound_Documents_Config) and select the **Table** *Dunning* and the **Print Format** *Mahnbrief (swat)*.
