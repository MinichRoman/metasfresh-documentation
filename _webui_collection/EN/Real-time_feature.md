## Overview
In metasfresh, each window and document has its own unique ID or hyperlink that you can share with colleagues in other locations so they can see exactly the same content as you, provided they have the same user rights.

For example, in a window in list view you can filter a table by date and copy the resulting hyperlink from the address bar of your browser and email it to a specific person who can then open that link in their browser to view your filter result.

In addition, two or more users who have the same link can simultaneously work in the same window and follow each other's input in real time.
In this way, metasfresh enables global, simultaneous team collaboration, ensuring that everyone can view the same data and that no unwanted duplicates are created.
