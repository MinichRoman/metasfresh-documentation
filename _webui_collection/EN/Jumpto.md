## Jumping via field
1. Hover with your mouse cursor over the label of the field whose content you want to review or edit, e.g. **Business Partner** in the sales order window.
1. If the field label is underlined, simply click on it.
1. A new tab window opens up showing you the field's detailed content.

**Important:** You might need to disable your pop-up blocker to make this feature work.
