## Jumping via field

1. Hover with your mouse cursor over the name of the field you want to review or edit the content of, e.g. "Business Partner" in the Sales Order window.
1. If the field name gets underlined, simply click on it.
1. A new tab opens up showing you the field's detailed content.

**Important**: You might need to disable your pop-up blocker to make this feature work.
