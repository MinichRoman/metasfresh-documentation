## Overview
A [pricing system](Add_price-system) comprises various [price lists](Add_price-list). These price lists may be country and currency-specific, so that they can be [assigned](Assign_prices_to_partner) to a particular [partner](New_Business_Partner) ([customer](New_business_partner_customer)/[vendor](New_business_partner_vendor)) or [partner group](New_Business_Partner_Group).
