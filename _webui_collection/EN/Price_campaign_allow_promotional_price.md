## Overview
In metasfresh, you can launch special price actions for a limited period of time in which a specific product is sold at a specific promotional price. This price will then apply either to single customers (provided they are eligible for price promotions) or to entire business partner groups. Consequently, all previously defined price conditions will be overridden during the promotion period and remain ineffective until the end of the promotion.

You can define individually which customers are authorized to participate in price promotions, e.g., if they belong to the same business partner group, but not all of them shall receive the promotional price. To do so, please proceed as follows:

## Steps
1. Open the entry of an existing [business partner](Menu) or [add a new one](New_business_partner_customer).
1. Go to the record tab "Customer" at the bottom of the page and move the horizontal scrollbar to the right until you reach the column **IsAllowActionPrice**.
1. Double-click the field **IsAllowActionPrice** of the customer line and tick the checkbox.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
