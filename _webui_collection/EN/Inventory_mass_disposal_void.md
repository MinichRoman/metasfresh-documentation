## Overview
If you reverse an internal use posting, all HUs that were disposed of will be reactivated and become available again for trade. To do so, please proceed as follows:

## Steps
1. Open "Internal Use" from the [menu](Menu).
1. Open the entry of a [posted internal use](Inventory_mass_disposal) you want to void.
1. Open the [document processing menu](StartAction) (`Alt` + `I` / `‚å• alt` + `I`) and click on *Void*.<br>
