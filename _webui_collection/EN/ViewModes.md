## <a name="list-view">List view</a>
All windows in metasfresh essentially open in the list view first. No editing can be done there, only [filtering](Filtering_function), [selecting](RecordSelection) and sorting data records.

## <a name="detailed-view">Detailed view</a>
By double-clicking on an entry in the list view or when [adding a new entry](New_Record_Window), metasfresh switches to the detailed view where data can be edited.

To switch back from the detailed view to the list view, simply click on the previous menu item in the breadcrumb navigation trail. Alternatively, you can also use the back button of your web browser.

See here how to switch between detailed view and list view:

## <a name="adv-edit">Advanced Edit</a>
The detailed view only shows the main, most frequently used fields. To see all fields of a data record and also edit the ones required for specific purposes, you can switch to the "Advanced Edit" menu via the [actions menu](StartAction#actions-menu). The same applies to the [tables in the record tabs](Open_AdvancedEditTab) in the bottom section of the data records.
 >**Note:** Use shortcut `Alt` + `E` / `‚å• alt` + `E` to open the advanced edit menu.
