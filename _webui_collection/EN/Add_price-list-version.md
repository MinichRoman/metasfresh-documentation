## Overview
![](assets/price system hierarchy - price list versions.png)

## Steps
1. Open the entry of an existing [price list](Menu) or [create a new one](Add_price-list).
1. Go to the record tab "Price List Version" at the bottom of the page and click !["Add new"](assets/Add_New_Button.png). An overlay window opens up.
1. Give the price list version a **Name** or instead use the suggested creation date.
1. Set a **Valid from** date for this version.
 >**Note:** If this date lies in the *past*, the version will be effective *immediately*. If it lies in the *future*, the prices will only be used *from that date*. metasfresh applies the prices according to the currently valid price list version based on the date promised of sales orders or purchase orders.

1. ***Optional:*** Select a **Price List Schema**.
1. ***Optional:*** Select a **Base Pricelist Version**.
 >**Note:** The **Price List Schema** and **Basis Pricelist Version** can be used to [create new price lists (or price list versions) and adjust product prices by applying pricing conditions](Copy_prices_from_price-list-version).

1. Click "Done" to close the overlay window and add the price list version to the list.
 >**Note:** Repeat steps 2 to 5 to add further price list versions.

## Next Steps
- [Add a price](Add_price).
