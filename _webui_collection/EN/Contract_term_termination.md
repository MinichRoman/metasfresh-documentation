## Overview
If you, for instance, made a mistake with [extending a contract](Extend_contract) and so only want to void a particular Contract Term without having to terminate the entire contract and draw up a new one, you can take the following steps:

## Steps
1. Follow these [instructions for terminating a Contract](Contract_termination) up to **Step 6**.
1. Check the box **Only Terminate Current Term**.
1. Click "Start" to execute the termination and close the window.
 >**Note:** The [Contractual Terms](Define_contractual_terms) determine the date by which a Contract can be terminated. If an error occurs, the termination may most likely not be permitted upon the date chosen.

1. In the [list view](ViewModes) of the Contracts you can review the **Contract Status**.
