## Overview
Sometimes the business partners' product names differ from your own ones even though they refer to the same product. For instance, in your system you hold the product *Carrots*, but the customer prefers calling it *Orange roots* and the vendor *Rabbit food*.<br>
So, in order to avoid any misunderstandings and ending up with several names for one individual product in your system, you can assign **partner-related product names** without having to modify your own internal data.

## Steps
1. Open an existing [product](Menu) or [create a new product](NewProduct).
1. Go to the tab "Business Partner" at the bottom of the page and click "Add new". A new window opens up.
1. Enter the name of the **Business Partner**.
 > Note 1: Business partners can be customers and vendors.<br><br>
 > Note 2: Hit `SPACE` to see all business partners.<br><br>
 > Note 3: Select one of the shown options with the mouse or ![](../DE/assets/Workflow_Auftrag_Bis_Rechnung_WebUI-73797.png)

1. Check the box **For Vendor** or **For Customer** according to the respective business partner for who the new name should be used.
1. Enter the partner-related **Product name**.
1. Enter the partner-related **Product number**.
1. Click "Done" to close the window and add the partner-related data to the list.
1. Repeat steps 2 to 7 for further business partners.

**Note:** For internal processes you keep using your own product names. Externally, the respective partner-related data will appear automatically on documents such as Sales Order confirmations, Shipment notes and Invoices.
