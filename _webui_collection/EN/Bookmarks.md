## Overview
The default menu lists only a part of the available items.<br>
Bookmarks can be used to structure the menu more clearly according to your personal needs. This way your most frequently used items are listed immediately after opening the menu.

## Steps

1. Open the [menu](Menu).
1. Click on **BROWSE WHOLE TREE**.
1. Hover with your mouse cursor over the menu item you want to bookmark.
1. A small blue star ![](assets/Bookmark_Star_blue.png) appears beside the item.
1. Click on the star to bookmark the item. The star turns green ![](assets/Bookmark_Star_green.png) and will remain beside the item.
 > Note: To remove a bookmark from an item, simply click on the green star. It will turn back to blue and then disappear.

1. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all items you want to bookmark.
1. Open the menu again to see your personalized list of items.
