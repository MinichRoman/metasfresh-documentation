## Steps
1. Open a [completed Contract](Create_contract).
1. Go to the actions menu (`Ctrl + 1`) and [start the action](StartAction) "Contract Change". A new window opens up.
1. Choose a **Change effective by** date.
1. Select the **Action** *Terminate*.
1. Click "Start" to execute the termination and close the window.
 >Note: The [Contractual Terms](Define_contractual_terms) determine the date by which a Contract can be terminated. If an error occurs, the termination may most likely not be permitted upon the date chosen.

1. In the [list view](ViewModes) of the Contracts you can review the **Contract Status**.
