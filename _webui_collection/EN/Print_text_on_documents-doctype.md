## Overview
In metasfresh you can record manual texts for every document type (e.g. bill of lading, incoming invoice, purchase order, sales order, quotation, etc.). Upon document creation, these texts will then be automatically placed in the spaces provided on the document. They can be placed both at the top and at the bottom of the document (see example [here](Print_text_on_documents-general)).

Furthermore, you can autonomously transfer these texts into your business partners’ languages so that when you [print commercial documents](PrintPreview) for foreign business partners, the texts will automatically appear in their respective languages on these documents.

## Steps
1. Open "Document Type" from the [menu](Menu).
1. Open the entry of an existing document type, e.g. "Quotation (Angebot)".
1. In the text box **Description** enter a text that you want to appear at the top of the document.
1. In the text box **Document Note** enter a text that you want to appear at the bottom of the document.
1. Make sure the box **Copy description to document** is checked to ensure that the texts are printed on the documents.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
