## Overview
There are two ways to add products to a [price list](Add_price-list):
1. [Assign a price to a product](ProductPrice).
1. [Add a price](Add_price).

There are also two ways to review which products are on a price list.

## Via Price List Version
1. Open the entry of an existing [price list](Menu) or [create a new one](Add_price-list).
1. Go to the record tab "[Price List Version](Add_price-list-version)" at the bottom of the page.
1. Use the [context menu](Jumpto_via_context_menu) ![](assets/Product Prices Contextmenu.png) of the line in question to switch into the window "Product Prices" where you will now see a list of all products on the price list.
 >**Note:** If the link "Product Prices" does not appear in the context menu, then no products have been added to the price list yet.

## Via Filtering Function
1. Open "Product Prices" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Use the filter](Filtering_function) to find the desired price list version.
1. You will now only see the products that are on the selected price list.
