## Overview
In metasfresh, you can send an email directly from the system to any partner you are communicating with (e.g., in sales orders or purchase orders).

## Steps
1. Open a desired window from the [menu](Menu), e.g. "Sales Order".
1. Open an entry, e.g., a [sales order](SalesOrder_recording).
1. Open the [actions menu](StartAction#actions-menu) ![](assets/actionsmenu_WebUI.png) and click on "Email". The email editor opens up.
 >**Note 1:** Alternatively, press `Alt` + `K` / `‚å• alt` + `K` to open the email editor.<br><br>
 >**Note 2:** The name of the recipient, if available, will be filled in automatically.

1. Compose your own text or pick a [text block](Create_boilerplate) from the boilerplate field at the top right of the email editor and edit it, if required.
 >**Note:** The template field will appear only if at least one template has been recorded under "[Boilerplate](Menu)" in the menu.

1. The referenced document (e.g., the sales order) will be automatically attached to the email. You can add additional documents by clicking on ![](assets/add_attachment.png) at the bottom left of the email editor.
1. Click ![](assets/send_email_button.png) to send the email.
