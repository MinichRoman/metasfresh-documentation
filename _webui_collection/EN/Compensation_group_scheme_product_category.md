## Overview
In metasfresh you can sort products with similar features into categories for clearer organization. During the group discounting process, these product categories in connection with the [compensation group scheme](Create_compensation_group_scheme) make it possible to automatically combine the products of one category to a compensation group.

In order to link the compensation group scheme to a product category, take the following steps:

## Steps
1. Open "Product Category" from the [menu](Menu).
1. Open the entry of an existing product category or [create a new one](NewProductCategory).
1. Go to the field **Compensation Group Scheme** and select the desired scheme, e.g. *Compensation Group I*.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).

## Alternate Configuration
Instead of linking a product category to a compensation group scheme, you can also subordinate it to another category which in turn is linked to a compensation group scheme. Consequently, during the group discounting process the scheme of the parent category will be applied to the compensation grouping. This way you can sort individual products into different categories and still give discounts on them as a group.

[Follow this link](ParentProductCategory) to the description on how to set a parent product category.
