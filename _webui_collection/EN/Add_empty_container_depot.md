## Overview
An empty container depot serves to store the empty containers that remain after the products they contain have been removed.

## Steps
1. Follow these [instructions for adding a warehouse](Add_new_warehouse) up to **step 3 of recording a place of storage**.
1. Go to the record tab "Lagerzuordnung" (*Warehouse Assignment*) at the bottom of the page and click ![](assets/Add_New_Button.png). An overlay window opens up.
1. Select the **Document Base Type** *Material Physical Inventory*.
1. Click "Done" to close the overlay window and add the document base type to the list.
 >**Note:** In order for the empty containers to be moved to the empty container depot for storage, you will need an appropriate [distribution network](Automatic_distribution_network)!
