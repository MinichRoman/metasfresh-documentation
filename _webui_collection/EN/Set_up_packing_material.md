## Overview
Packing material is used for packaging products ([CU](Handling_Unit_System)) and may differ depending on the nature of the product.

In metasfresh, packing material is treated as a product and added to sales or purchase orders automatically after their completion.

## Requirements
- Before packing material can be used as such in metasfresh, it must first be [added to your products](NewProduct).

## Steps
1. Open "Packing Material" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Create a new entry](New_Record_Window).
1. Give the packing material a **Name**.
1. In the field **Product**, select the desired packing material, e.g., *Euro Container*.
1. ***Optional:*** In the field **Unit Measurements**, select the unit for the measurements of the packing material and enter the respective dimensions into the fields **Length**, **Width** and **Height**.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).

## Next Steps
- [Create packing instructions](Create_packing_instructions) that make use of the packing material.
