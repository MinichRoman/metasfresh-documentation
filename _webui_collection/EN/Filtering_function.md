## Overview
If you are searching for specific entries in a window (such as [business partners](New_Business_Partner), [sales orders](SalesOrder_recording), [products](NewProduct), etc.) you can display them separately by using the filtering function.

## Steps
1. [Open a window](Menu) of your choice in [list view](ViewModes), e.g., "[Sales Order](Menu)".
1. Click ![](assets/Filter button.png) at the top left of the window to open the filter mask and then click ![](assets/Filter button_Default.png).
1. Enter the desired keywords into the search fields and/or pick the desired [attributes](Add_attributes_to_BP) by which you want to filter the table and click ![](assets/Apply button.png).
 >**Note:** Press `Alt` + `↵ Enter` / `⌥ alt` + `↵ Enter` to apply the filter criteria.

1. To empty the search fields, click ![](assets/Filter_by_X.png) and then click ![](assets/Clear_filter.png) in the top right-hand corner of the filter mask.

## Next Steps (optional)
- [Use the area search to limit the filter results to a specific geographical area](Area_search_geocoding).
