A pricing system comprises one or more country price lists that can be [assigned to a customer/vendor](Assign_prices_to_partner) or a [partner group](Assign_prices_to_partner_group).

You can find further details on the difference between *pricing system* and *price list* [here](Price-system_versus_price-list).

## Steps
1. Open "Price System" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Create a new pricing system](New_Record_Window).
1. Give the pricing system a **Name**.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).

## Next Steps
- [Add a price list](Add_price-list).
