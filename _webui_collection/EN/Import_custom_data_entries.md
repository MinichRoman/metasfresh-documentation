## Requirements
Make sure to comply with all requirements for the [data import in metasfresh](Data_import_metasfresh). [Here you can find a format example for importing custom data entries](Import_format_example_data_entry).
 >**Note:** For importing custom data entries, you require an import format that is configured with the **database table** *Import Data Entry Record*.

## Steps
1. Open "Data Import" from the [menu](Menu).
1. Open a suitable data import entry or [add a new one](add_new_data_import_entry).

### Upload and import the file
1. [Upload your import file containing the custom data entries](File_handling).
1. [Start the action](StartAction) "Import attachment". An overlay window opens up.
1. In the field **Attachment**, select the uploaded [import file](Import_file_useful_tips).
1. Click "Start" to import the custom data entries and close the overlay window.

### Review Custom Data Entries
1. Open "Import - Custom data entry" from the [menu](Menu). Here you will find all imported custom data entries.
1. Open the custom data entry you want to review and correct, if necessary.
 - If all data were transferred properly and without errors, this entry will be read-only and you can find the imported data in the respective input window in the [menu](Menu). All further changes can be made there.
 - In case data were transferred incorrectly or are missing after the import, you can review and edit all custom data entries under "[Import - Custom data entry](Menu)". After having rectified all inaccuracies, you can now manually import the custom data entries. To do so, please proceed as follows:

#### Manual Custom Data Entry Import
1. [Start the action](StartAction) "Import - Erweiterte Dateneingabe" (*Import - Custom Data Entry*). An overlay window opens up.
1. Click "Start" to import the custom data entries and close the overlay window.
1. You will find the imported custom data entries in the respective input window in the [menu](Menu).
