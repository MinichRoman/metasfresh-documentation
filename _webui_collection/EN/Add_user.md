## Overview
Generally speaking, users are contacts who you can register in the system in addition to your existing business partners.

You can also register your business partners as users, e.g., for sending [serial letters](Create_serial_letters) to them as part of a [marketing campaign](Create_MKTG_campaign).

In order to add new users, take the following steps:

## Steps
1. [Log in to the system](Login).
1. Open "User" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Add a new user](New_Record_Window).
1. Fill in the fields **Firstname** and **Lastname**.
1. Enter the user's **Email Address**.
1. The **Search Key** is an automatically assigned serial number. However, if required, you can also assign your own search key manually instead.

## Next Steps (optional)
- [Turn the user into a system user](New_system_user) and [assign a role to the system user](Assign_user_role) in order to grant them access to the system.
- [Assign a business partner to the user](Assign_BPartner_to_user).
