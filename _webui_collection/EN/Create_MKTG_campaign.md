## Overview
A marketing campaign makes it extremely easy for you to provide a great number of your contacts with information of interest to them in just one go.

In metasfresh, there are two types of marketing campaigns: *e-mail campaigns* and *serial letter campaigns*.

In the *e-mail campaigns*, newsletters are sent out to the selected contacts via e-mail. In the *serial letter campaigns*, [serial letters](Create_serial_letters) are created and labelled automatically with the respective contacts' default address stored in metasfresh, where they can then be sent by post.

## Requirements
The following components are required for a marketing campaign:
- A [marketing platform](Create_MKTG_platform) determining the address type of the marketing contacts.
- A [boiler plate](Create_boiler_plate) with a text template for the e-mails or serial letters.

## Steps
1. Open "Marketing Campaign" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Create a new marketing campaign](New_Record_Window).
1. Give the marketing campaign a **Name**.
1. In the field [**Marketing Platform**](Create_MKTG_platform), enter a part of the marketing platform and click on the matching result in the [drop-down list](Keyboard_shortcuts_reference).
1. Select a **Boiler Plate**.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).

## Next Steps
- [Add contacts to the marketing campaign](Add_contacts_to_MKTG_campaign).
