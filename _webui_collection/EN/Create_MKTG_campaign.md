## Overview
A marketing campaign makes it extremely easy for you to provide a great number of your contacts with information of interest to them in just one go.

In metasfresh, there are two types of marketing campaigns: *email campaigns* and *serial letter campaigns*.

In the *email campaigns*, newsletters are sent out to the selected contacts via email. In the *serial letter campaigns*, [serial letters](Create_serial_letters) are created and labelled automatically with the respective contacts' default address stored in metasfresh, where they can then be sent by post.

## Requirements
The following components are required for a marketing campaign:
- A [marketing platform](Create_MKTG_platform) determining the address type of the marketing contacts.
- A [boiler plate](Create_boiler_plate) with a text template for the emails or serial letters.

## Steps
1. Open "Marketing Campaign" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Create a new marketing campaign](New_Record_Window).
1. Give the marketing campaign a **Name**.
1. In the field **Marketing Platform**, enter a part of the marketing platform and click on one of the results.
 >**Note 1:** Hit `SPACE` to see all available [marketing platforms](Create_MKTG_platform).<br><br>
 >**Note 2:** Select one of the shown options with the mouse or ![](../DE/assets/Workflow_Auftrag_Bis_Rechnung_WebUI-73797.png).
