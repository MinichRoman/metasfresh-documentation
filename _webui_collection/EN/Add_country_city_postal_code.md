## Overview
When [recording a location](Add_address_tab), entering only the city and postal code may at times be a little too vague. For a more accurate determination, it may be helpful to indicate the respective districts as well, so that locations that have the same postal code due to their geographical proximity can still be distinguished.

This is why metasfresh allows you to manually add as many city entries as you require and specify the postal code, township, district, region and country in more detail. To do so, please proceed as follows:

## Steps
1. Open "Country, City and Postal" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Add a new city entry](New_Record_Window).
1. Enter the **City Name**, e.g., "Bonn".
1. In the field **Postal**, enter the postal code, e.g., "53179".
1. In the field **Region**, enter the (federal) state/province or equivalent, e.g., "NRW".
1. Pick the **Country**, e.g., *Germany*.
1. Enter the **Township**, e.g., "Mehlem".
1. Enter the **District**, e.g., "Bad Godesberg".
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).

## Next Steps (optional)
- [Use the area search to limit the results when filtering entries to a specific geographical area](Area_search_geocoding).
