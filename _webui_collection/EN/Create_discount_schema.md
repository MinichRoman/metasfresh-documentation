## Steps
1. Open "Discount Schema" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Create a new discount schema](New_Record_Window).
1. Give the discount schema a **Name**.
1. Select the **Discount Type** *Breaks*.
1. Set a **Valid from** date.
 >**Note:** If this date lies in the *past*, the discount schema is effective *immediately*. If it lies in the *future*, the schema will only apply *from that date*.

1. Go to the record tab "Discount Break" at the bottom of the page and click ![](assets/Add_New_Button.png). A new window opens up.
1. ***Optional:*** Select a **Product** or a **Product Category**.
 >**Note:** In this case, the pricing conditions apply ***only*** to the selected product or category. If the fields remain empty, the pricing conditions apply to all the products on the price list.

1. In the field **Break Value** enter the amount at which a pricing condition is to apply.
1. In the field **Break Discount %** enter a percentage.
 >**Note:** If this percentage is a negative amount, the discount will be treated as a surcharge at the point of calculation.

1. Click "Done" to close the window and add the pricing conditions to the list.
 >**Note:** Repeat steps 6 to 10 to add further pricing conditions, such as for tiered discounts or discounts for additional products/product categories.
