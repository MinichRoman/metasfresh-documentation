## Steps
1. Open the entry of an existing [business partner](Menu) in the [detailed view](ViewModes) or [add a new one](New_Business_Partner).
1. Go to the record tab "Location" at the bottom of the page and click !["Add new"](assets/Add_New_Button.png). An overlay window opens up.
1. ***Optional:*** In the field **Name of BPartner**, enter an alternative name that shall appear as recipient on the supporting documents instead of the business partner/company name.
 >**Note:** Unless an alternative partner name is specified, the name from the business partner entry will be used by default.

1. Give the location entry a **Name**, e.g., "Headquarters", "Branch office" or similar.
1. To enter an **Address**, click on the !["Edit"](assets/Edit_address_button.png) button.
1. Enter the **Street & House No.**, **ZIP** code, **City** and **Country** of the company.
 >**Note:** If you choose, e.g., "United States" as **Country**, you can also enter the **Region**. Simply close and re-open the address editing window by clicking the edit button twice and the field will appear above **Country**.

1. Enter the company's **GLN** (Global Location Number), if available.
1. Use the checkboxes to configure the location entry as required, e.g., **Ship Address**, **Is Invoice Default**, **Handover Location**, **Visitors Address**, etc.
1. Click "Done" to close the overlay window and add the address to the list.
 >**Note:** You can add several addresses this way, if required.

1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
