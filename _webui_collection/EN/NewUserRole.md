## Overview
A user role enables you to specify which features the user can access and which data they can view.

## Steps
1. Open "Role" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Create a new role](New_Record_Window).
1. Give the role a **Name**, e.g., "Standard".
1. Set a [**Max Query Records**](Max_query_records_userrole) limit.

### Assign the role to a system user
1. Go to the record tab "User Assignment" at the bottom of the page and click ![](assets/Add_New_Button.png). An overlay window opens up.
1. In the field **User/Contact**, enter a part of the [system user](New_system_user) name and click on the matching result in the [drop-down list](Keyboard_shortcuts_reference).
1. Click "Done" to close the overlay window and add the system user to the list.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
