## Overview
In metasfresh you can define whether a business partner is a customer, vendor or both. Additionally, you can preconfigure the commercial terms and conditions that will then be set as default for all future business documents.

## Steps

### Business Partner as Vendor
1. Open a [business partner](New_Business_Partner) entry in the [detailed view](ViewModes).
1. Go to the record tab "Vendor" at the bottom of the page.
1. Open the [advanced edit menu](Open_AdvancedEditTab).
1. Check the box **Vendor**.
1. Optionally, you can add further terms and conditions, such as **Payment Rule**, **Shipment** ('*Pickup*' or '*Shipper*'), **Payment Term**, **Price System** etc.
1. Click "Done" to close the window and add the terms and conditions to the tab.
