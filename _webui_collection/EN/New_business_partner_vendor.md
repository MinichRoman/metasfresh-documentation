1. Go to the record tab "Vendor" at the bottom of the page.
1. Open the [advanced edit menu](Open_AdvancedEditTab) of the vendor line.
1. Check the box **Vendor**.
1. Select a **Purchase Price System**.
1. Select a [**PO Discount Schema**](Pricing_conditions_in_metasfresh).
1. ***Optional:*** Add further terms and conditions, such as **Payment Rule**, **Shipment** ('*Pickup*' or '*Shipper*'), **Payment Term**, etc.
1. Click "Done" to apply the changes and close the advanced edit menu.
