## Overview
In many windows that include entries associated with [business partners](New_Business_Partner) (e.g., in the menu under [sales order](SalesOrder_recording), [purchase order](CreatePurchaseOrder), [business partner](New_Business_Partner), [phone call schedule](Phone_call_scheduling), etc.), you can use the area search to limit the search results to a specific geographical area.

## Requirements
- [Add a business partner along with an address](Add_address_tab).

| Important note! |
| :--- |
| For the area search to work smoothly, the address must include ***at a minimum*** a postal code (**ZIP**), the **City** and the **Country**. |

## Steps
1. Open a window of your choice where the area search is available in [list view](ViewModes), e.g., "[Business Partner](Menu)".
1. Click ![](assets/Filter button.png) at the top left of the window and then click ![](assets/Filter_area_search.png).
1. As required, enter **Street & House No.**, **ZIP**, **City** and/or **Country**.
1. Enter a **Distance** and click ![](assets/Apply button.png).
 >**Note:** Press `Alt` + `↵ Enter` / `⌥ alt` + `↵ Enter` to apply the filter criteria.
