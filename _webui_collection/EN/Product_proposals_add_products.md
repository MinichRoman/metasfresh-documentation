## Overview
You can open the product proposals list under [sales orders](SalesOrder_recording), [purchase orders](CreatePurchaseOrder) and [business partners](New_Business_Partner) in the menu. It enables you to compare product prices for various business partners as well as to edit prices and price lists without taking the long way via the menu.
