## Overview

In metasfresh there are [Sales Price Lists and Purchase Price Lists](Add_price-list). The sales price lists can be assigned to customers and the purchase price lists to vendors.

## Assign Sales Price List to Customer

In order to obtain a Sales Price List you have to check the box **Sales Price List** in the corresponding [price list](Add_price-list) entry. Once this is done, you can continue with these steps:

### Steps
1. Open an existing customer entry from your [business partners](Menu) or [create a new customer](New_business_partner_customer).
1. Go to the tab "Customer" at the bottom of the page.
1. Double-click the field **Price System** of the customer line and select the desired [price system](Add_price-system) from the drop-down list.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
