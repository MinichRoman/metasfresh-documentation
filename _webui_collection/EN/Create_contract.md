## Overview
A Contract in metasfresh is a Sales Order in kind of a subscription to a regular shipment of products during a certain period of time.

## Steps
To create a Contract, simply follow the same steps as for a [Sales Order](SalesOrder_recording). However, before completing the document, make sure to complete these steps first:

1. Move the horizontal scrollbar of the order line table to the right until you reach the column **Terms & Conditions**.
1. Double-click the field **Terms & Conditions** of the order lines and select the desired [Contractual Terms](Define_contractual_terms) from the drop-down list.
 >**Note on changing the Contractual Terms:** After the one-time selection of the Contractual Terms you cannot change them anymore. To use other Contractual Terms, simply delete the order line and add it again.

**Note 1:** The field **Date Promised** now determines the ***Contract Start*** date.

**Note 2:** After completing the Sales Order you will find the Contract under "[Contract](Menu)" in the menu. You can also jump **directly** to the Contract from the Sales Order via the [related documents](JumptoviaSidebar).
