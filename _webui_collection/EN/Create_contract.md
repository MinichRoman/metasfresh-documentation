## Overview
A contract in metasfresh is a sales order in the form of a subscription to a regular shipment of products during a certain period of time.

## Steps
To create a contract, simply follow the same steps as for a [sales order](SalesOrder_recording). However, ***before completing the document***, make sure to complete these steps first:

1. Move the horizontal scrollbar of the order line table to the right until you reach the column **Terms & Conditions**.
1. Double-click the field **Terms & Conditions** of the order lines and select the desired [contractual terms](Define_contractual_terms) from the drop-down list.
 >**Note on changing the contractual terms:** After selecting the contractual terms for the first time you cannot change them anymore. To apply other contractual terms, simply delete the order line and add it again.

| **Note 1:** |
| :- |
| The field **Date Promised** now determines the ***Contract Start*** date. |

| **Note 2:** |
| :- |
| After completing the sales order you will find the contract under "[Contract](Menu)" in the menu. You can also jump ***directly*** to the contract from the sales order via the [related documents](JumptoviaSidebar). |
