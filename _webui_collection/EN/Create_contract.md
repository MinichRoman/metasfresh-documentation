## Overview
A Contract in metasfresh is a Sales Order in kind of a subscription to a regular shipment of products during a certain period of time.

## Steps
To create a Contract, simply follow the same steps as for a [Sales Order](SalesOrder_recording). However, before completing the document, make sure to complete these steps first:

1. Move the horizontal scrollbar of the order line table to the right until you find the column **Terms & Conditions**.
1. Double-click the field **Terms & Conditions** of the order lines and select the desired [Contractual Terms](Define_contractual_terms) from the drop-down list.

**Note**: After completing the contract you will find it under "[Contract](Menu)" in the menu.
