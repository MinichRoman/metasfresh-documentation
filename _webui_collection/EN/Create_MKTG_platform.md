## Overview
By means of the marketing platform, you can determine which address type shall be used when [adding contacts to a marketing campaign](Add_contacts_to_MKTG_campaign). You may choose between the [*business partner's default address*](Add_address_tab) (**Requires Location**) and the [*user's email address*](Add_user) (**Requires Mail Address**). Of course, you may also combine the two address types.

If you choose **Requires Location**, the subsequent campaign will be a [*serial letter campaign*](Create_serial_letters) where only those contacts will be included that are stored in the system with a default address (business partners).

If you choose **Requires Mail Address**, the subsequent campaign will be an *email campaign* where only those contacts will be included that are stored in the system with an email address (users).

## Steps
1. Open "Marketing Platform" from the [menu](Menu).
1. [Create a new marketing platform](New_Record_Window).
1. Select a **Marketing Platform Gateway ID**, e.g., *CleverReach*.
1. Give the marketing platform a **Name**.
1. Check either **Requires Location**, **Requires Mail Address** or both boxes, depending on your requirements.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).
