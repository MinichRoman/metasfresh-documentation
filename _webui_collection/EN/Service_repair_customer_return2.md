## Overview

Sometimes customers may report faulty products and send them back for repair in order to receive a mended product back in return (as a gesture of goodwill, if applicable). In metasfresh, such cases can be handled via the service reception and repairs incl. spare parts, other services, etc. can be carried out as part of manufacturing orders.

### Adding Spare Parts for a repair

| The Accessories of a manufacturing product also need an extra [Spare Parts BOM](Create_BOM#spare-parts-bom). This is in addition to the [Bill of Materials (BOM)](Create_BOM) that contains all components for the manufacturing (material or immaterial, e.g. services). |

1. [Start the Action](StartAction#actions-menu) "Add Spare Parts" and an overlay will open.
1. Select the **product** that shall be used as spare part
 > **Info:** The fields **UOM (Unit of Measurement)** and **Quantity** are filled automatically with values from the Spare Parts BOM of the selected product.
