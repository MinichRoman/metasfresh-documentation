## Overview
In metasfresh, you can also use the *zoom feature* to access the content of many table fields. Often this is a good way to bypass the navigation menu and quickly switch between the windows.

This feature is available for tables in [list view](ViewModes) as well as in the record tab context.

## Steps
1. Hover with your mouse cursor over the table field whose content you want to review or edit, and right-click it to open the context menu.
1. Click on ![](assets/zoom_into_context.png) to switch into the respective window.
1. The window opens up in a new browser tab.
