## Requirements
- [Record a sales partner with whom a commission contract is to be concluded](Add_new_sales_partner).

## Steps
1. Open the entry of an existing customer from your [business partners](Menu) or [add a new one](New_business_partner_customer).
1. In the field **Sales partner** (on the right-hand side), enter a part of the name or number of the sales partner to be assigned and click on the matching result in the <a href="Keyboard_shortcuts_reference#dropdown" title="Dynamic Search Box (Autocompletion)">drop-down list</a>.
1. [metasfresh saves the progress automatically](Saveindicator).

### Sales order only with sales partner (optional)
Tick the checkbox **Sales partner required** to specify that sales orders for the current customer cannot be completed unless a sales partner is used.
