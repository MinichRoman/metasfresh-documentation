1. [Jump to](JumptoviaSidebar) "Invoice Disposition".
1. [Select the order lines](RecordSelection) you want to invoice.
1. [Start the action](StartAction) "Generate Invoices". An overlay window opens up.
1. Click "Start" to confirm and close the overlay window.
1. You will receive a notification ![](assets/NotificationBell_WebUI.png) in the upper right corner once the invoice is generated.
1. Click on the notification to open the invoice document.

## Next Steps (optional)
Did you make a mistake when creating the invoice or would you like to subsequently change its recipient? Not a problem! Simply
- [cancel the invoice](Invoice_reverse_correct) and correct it, and/or
- [change the bill-to information](Bill-to_info_subsequent_change) as required.
