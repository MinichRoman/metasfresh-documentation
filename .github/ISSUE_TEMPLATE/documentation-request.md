To reduce checkbacks and thus speed up the documentation process, please add **all necessary and helpful information** here and link to issue(s) with relevant information.
If you'd like to suggest an update of an existing documentation page, please also include its URL and those of any related/affected pages.

As a guideline, please
- name and describe the topic/feature/context you are referring to in coherent units and as **detailed and specific** as possible. Such details may include
    - describing how the feature fits into the [**operational structure**](https://www.quam.cloud/en-us/knowledgebase/quam53-glossar-ablauforganisation-en-us) of a business ("bird's eye perspective") - i.e. moving down from the global process into the individual procedures and work steps, which can eventually be linked together again to create a comprehensive guide (instruction manual) of the feature at hand.
    - indicating **dependencies/prerequisites** (such as previously created documents, system configurations, etc.).
    - anything that helps the next person to understand what they are looking at when they are confronted with the feature **for the first time**.
- assume the **user's perspective** when describing the topic/feature/context, e.g.,
    - What **user problem** is solved?
    - Is there anything that **cannot be expected** from the user to know (like where a specific process is located within the WebUI)?
    - What other **background info** is relevant for the user to be able to help themselves (e.g., related features, WebUI doc guides, etc.)?
- formulate **what needs to be done/documented** with as much detail as possible.
- try to "translate" any developer jargon as **generally intelligible** as possible.
- if you're referring to any online sources, please **include those URLs** as well.

Generally, when creating a documentation request, assume that the recipient does **not have the same knowledge basis** as you do and is grateful for any **explanation of implicit concepts** up front.
Keeping these points in mind, you may now overwrite this note and continue with capturing your documentation request. Thank you in advance for your collaboration. We look forward to receiving your contribution! â€“*metas GmbH*
