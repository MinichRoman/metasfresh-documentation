To reduce checkbacks and thus speed up the documentation process, please add **all necessary and helpful information** here and link to issue(s) with relevant information.
If you'd like to suggest an update of an existing documentation page, please also include its URL and those of any related/affected pages.

As a guideline, please
- name and describe the topic/feature/context you are referring to as **detailed and specific** as possible.
- Assume the **user's perspective** when describing the topic/feature/context, e.g.,
    - What user problem is solved?
    - Is there anything that cannot be expected from the user to know (like where a specific process is located)?
    - What other background info is relevant for the user to be able to help themselves (e.g., related features, docs, etc.)?
- formulate **what needs to be done/documented** with as much detail as possible.
- try to "translate" any developer jargon as **generally intelligible** as possible.
- if you're referring to any online sources, please **include these URLs** as well.

Generally, when creating a documentation request, assume that the recipient does **not have the same knowledge basis** as you do and is grateful for any **explanation of implicit concepts** up front.
Keeping these points in mind, you may now overwrite this note and continue with capturing your documentation request. Thank you in advance for your collaboration. We look forward to receiving your contribution! â€“*metas GmbH*
