Here is an example for generated desadv files:

{{ include_relative ../../common/extract_POReference_from_EDI_file_bash.md }}

Notes: 

* the snipped looks at files in the current directory which start with "desadv".
* it extracts whatever the file contains in the second line, chars 210 until 221 and writes it to a text file.

This snipped is very usefull if you have a bunch of EDI files generated by metasfresh and you need to know the POReferences of all shipments (```M_InOut``` records) that made it into EDI files.
