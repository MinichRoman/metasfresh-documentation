Here is an example for generated desadv files:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
FILES=./desadv*

for f in $FILES
do 
 sed '2!d' $f | cut -c 210-221 >> ./list_desadv.txt
done
``` 

Notes: 

* the snipped looks at files in the current directory which start with "desadv".
* it extracts whatever the file contains in the second line, chars 210 until 221 and writes it to a text file.

This snipped is very usefull if you have a bunch of EDI files generated by metasfresh and you need to know the POReferences of all shipments (```M_InOut``` records) that made it into EDI files.
